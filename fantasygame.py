# dragonLoot = ['gold coin', 'dagger', 'gold coin', 'gold coin', 'ruby']

# Write a function named addToInventory(inventory, addedItems), where the 
# inventory parameter is a dictionary representing the player’s inventory (like 
# in the previous project) and the addedItems parameter is a list like dragonLoot.
